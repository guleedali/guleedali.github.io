We welcome creative, outside-the-box directions and collaborations. We are building a diverse, multidisciplinary group that uses fieldwork and high-precision geochronology as a springboard for new ideas. Our goal is to learn how past climate and Earth systems ticked–and what those records signal for the future of the planet’s residents, human and not.
