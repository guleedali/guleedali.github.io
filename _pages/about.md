In the LAYERS group, we read the geologic record like a photo album, watching time and space shift from one layer to the next. On foot, across the water, or from the air, we map, log, and correlate sediments and landforms, then stitch those snapshots into a time framework with high-precision geochronology to tell the story of how wind, water, and ice reshaped the landscape.

We welcome creative ideas, unconventional directions, and collaborations that challange standard approaches and wisdom.

See News for opportunities to join the group!
