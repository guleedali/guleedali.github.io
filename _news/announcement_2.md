The Landscape Archives and Earth Systems (LAYERS) Group is recruiting. We are a new research group in the Department of Geosciences, Stony Brook University, working in partnership with the FIRST Lab (PI: Dr. Troy Rasbury).  



We welcome creative, outside-the-box directions and collaborations. We are building a diverse, multidisciplinary group that uses fieldwork and high-precision geochronology as a springboard for new ideas. Our goal is to learn how past climate and Earth systems ticked--and what those records signal for the future of the planet's residents, human and not.

We are recruiting graduate students to join a research program focused on:

1. Previously unrecognized ice sheet and mountain glacier responses to climate shifts.

2. Abrupt rainbelt migrations--and their ecological and cultural consequences--across the mid-latitudes and tropics

3. Cave speleothems as archives of past climate and environmental change

4. Reconstructions of past sea level

5. The interplay between tectonics, volcanism, and climate

These themes reflect current directions, not the limits of where we can go. Students are encouraged to explore, bring their own questions, and help shape new research directions for the group.
