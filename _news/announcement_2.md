The Landscape Archives and Earth Systems (LAYERS) Group is recruiting. We are a new research group in the Department of Geosciences, Stony Brook University, with partnership with FIRST Lab, led by PI Dr. Troy Rasbury.  

---

We seek graduate students to join our research which pursues these frontiers:

1. Revealing previously unrecognized ice sheet and mountain glacier responses to climate shifts.

2. Tracing abrupt rainbelt migrations--and their ecological and cultural consequences--across the mid-latitudes and tropics

3. Novel geochemical and isotopic tracers of climatic and environmental change in cave speleothems

4. Probing the interplay between teconics, volcanism, and climate

5. Impacts of climate change on migrations

6. Other projects that consider unconventional methods or starting points

> We welcome creative, outside-the-box directions and collaborations. I am building a diverse, multidisciplinary group that uses fieldwork and high-precision geochronology as a springboard for new ideas. We want to learn how past climate and Earth systems ticked--and what those records signal for the future of the planet's residents, human and not.
